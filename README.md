# React + TypeScript + Vite

1. App Component (App.tsx):

Responsibility: Acts as the main entry point for your application, handling routing and rendering of other components.
Data Flow: Determines which component to display based on the current route.
Use Cases: This component is responsible for navigating between different views of your application, such as login, signup, and the main data visualization dashboard.

2. Login Component (Login.tsx):

Responsibility: Provides a user login form and handles user authentication.
Data Flow: Stores and retrieves login details using localStorage. Redirects to the main dashboard on successful login.
Use Cases: Allows users to log in with their credentials to access the main dashboard. It ensures that only authenticated users can view sensitive data.

3. Signup Component (Signup.tsx):

Responsibility: Provides a user signup form and handles user registration.
Data Flow: Stores signup details in localStorage. Checks for existing accounts and displays an alert if the user tries to register with duplicate information.
Use Cases: Allows new users to create accounts to access the application. Ensures that each user has a unique set of credentials.

4. MainComponent (MainComponent.tsx):

Responsibility: Displays data retrieved from an external API in a tabular format (data grid).
Data Flow: Fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and renders it in a data grid. Requires user authentication via login.
Use Cases: Offers a data visualization dashboard for authenticated users. Allows users to view and interact with external data in a structured manner.

5. DepartmentList Component (DepartmentList.tsx):

Responsibility: Presents a hierarchical list of departments and sub-departments with checkboxes.
Data Flow: Manages the open/close state of departments and sub-departments using local component state.
Use Cases: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to explore and interact with departmental data. Enables users to expand and collapse departments to focus on specific areas of interest.

Data Flow:

User login and signup details are stored in localStorage for persistence.
The App component handles routing based on user actions and displays the appropriate component.
Login and Signup components interact with localStorage for user authentication and registration.
MainComponent fetches data from an external API based on user authentication.
DepartmentList component manages the UI state for expanding and collapsing departmental data.
Use Cases:

-Users can log in to access the application, ensuring secure access to sensitive data.
-New users can register and create accounts.
-Authenticated users can view and interact with external data in a structured manner.
-Users can explore and filter departmental data using the hierarchical list.
-The application provides a clean and organized dashboard for data visualization.
-Your application serves as a secure data visualization platform, allowing users to log in, register, and explore departmental data efficiently. -It showcases the use of localStorage, routing, and external data integration, making it a valuable learning project for web development and authentication concepts.
